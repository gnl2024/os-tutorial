    *** Release 9.5.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.5.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Unbreak build using ld.gold as linker.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

2025-07-14  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.5.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.4.0:

    New features:
        - protocols/efi: Hybridise loading mechanism with old memory-device
          based approach. This may work around the redundant requirement that
          EFI applications be signed, and it may fix certain issues created
          when the chainload mechanism was changed in 9.0.1.

    Bug fixes:
        - `limine` host tool: Fix some mismatched printf format specifiers.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.
        - Many dependencies had their commits bumped, some new dependencies
          were added (limine-protocol), some were changed (libfdt moved to a
          different repository that only includes BSD-2-Clause licensable
          code).

2025-07-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.4.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.4:

    New features:
        - BLI: Implement `LoaderTimeInitUSec` and `LoaderTimeExecUSec`.
          These are variables used by `systemd-analyze` and are useful for boot
          performance metrics.
        - Limine boot protocol: Add bootloader performance feature.
          This feature provides the same information as the new Boot Loader
          Interface variables, but encoded in a nicer way for Limine protocol
          executables.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Use `nm` instead of `objdump` for generating the symbol table, which
          results in a better, more consistent output, especially for non-x86
          architectures.
        - Miscellaneous build system updates and improvements.

2025-06-21  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.4 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.3:

    Bug fixes:
        - ELF: Make an optimisation related to skipping scanning of .bss
          regions for finding of structures in the loaded image (for Limine
          protocol structures or otherwise) less overeager as that could break
          in certain cases.
        - SMP: On x86, ensure that the value of IA32_APIC_BASE is the same on
          the APs as it is on the BSP.
        - PMM: Mark EfiLoader{Code,Data} regions as bootloader reclaimable
          rather than reserved memory, as for certain protocols, like the
          Limine boot protocol, reserved memory is unmapped at runtime, while
          these regions may contain hot data that is still needed, like Limine
          bootloader memory stacks.

2025-05-27  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Reinstate the limit for scanned drives to 0xf0. This is due to a
          report of int 13h hangs when used on drives >=0xf0.

2025-05-19  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - PMM: Mark EfiBootServices{Code,Data} memory regions as bootloader
          reclaimable instead of usable free memory as apparently the ACPI
          and UEFI specifications make no guarantees about useful structures
          being left in these areas after leaving boot services (namely BGRT
          and ESRT).

2025-05-15  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.3.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Remove .git directory mistakenly left over inside release tarballs.
        - Fix bug that would lead to panics when booting Linux protocol kernels
          without modules on x86.

2025-05-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.3.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.3:

    New features:
        - Add optional support for the 64-bit x86-64 boot protocol for Linux.
          This is supported on the UEFI/x86-64 port of Limine, and it is
          preferred over the 32-bit boot protocol if supported by the given
          kernel. This helps with loading larger modules on certain systems
          with low amounts of low memory which would otherwise panic.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix away some ungraceful handling of out-of-memory situations when
          loading files using the Linux boot protocol. Make into panics instead
          of crashes or hangs.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Improve performance and memory usage of loading modules for the Linux
          boot protocol.

2025-04-12  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix issues introduced by the stb_image fix introduced in 9.2.1 which
          could cause hangs or crashes when certain wallpaper images are used.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Update cc-runtime to new, integer-only, packed version.

2025-03-31  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Two quick bug fixes and workarounds in order to make multiboot2 more
          resilient when booting specific kernels such as Xen.
        - Avoid mistakenly allocating more memory than necessary when creating
          the volume index.

2025-03-25  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.2.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix potential buffer overflow bug with our stb_image support code.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Dynamically allocate volume index instead of relying on a hard coded
          limit and a fixed allocation. This fixes potential panics or failure
          to access volumes on systems with a lot of drives/partitions.
        - Limine boot protocol/ELF: Print the name of unresolved symbols on
          panic.

2025-03-16  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.2.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.3:

    New features:
        - Introduce initial support for the Boot Loader Interface
          specification.
        - Add /EFI/limine/limine.conf to the paths tried for config file when
          using EFI.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Do not try config path /EFI/BOOT/limine.conf unless booted using EFI.

2025-03-13  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Loongarch64: Fix alignment of TLB-refill handler.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Many fixes and improvements to documentation, installed or otherwise,
          including further licensing clarifications.

2025-03-11  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.1:

    This release does not change anything code-wise, but rather it focuses on
    sorting out the licensing mess of Nyu-EFI, by updating it to the latest
    revision which tackles this problem, and furthermore it improves the
    COPYING file to be more explicit about submodules and their licensing.

2025-03-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.1.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Do not use ConOut for serial output exclusively unless serial is
          verified to be present to the best of our abilities. This fixes an
          issue where if `serial=yes` is used on some machines (including
          several Apple Mac models) a black screen will be shown instead of the
          Limine menu.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Begin signing tarballs and (most) commits.

2025-03-07  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.1.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.0.1:

    New features:
        - `limine` host tool: When using the `bios-install` command on an
          ISOHYBRID with a GPT, automatically convert it to MBR, if possible
          and unless explicitly disabled, in order to enhance compatibility of
          said ISOHYBRIDs with many systems (of note, Lenovo Thinkpads).

2025-02-25  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.0.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 9.0.0:

    Miscellaneous:
        - EFI chainload: Replace old chainload method with one that is more
          friendly to other EFI bootloaders such as rEFInd.
        - Limine boot protocol/PE: Map previously unmapped PE image headers.

2025-02-17  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 9.0.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.7.0:

    Breaking changes:
        - Support for the ext2/3/4 filesystems has been once again dropped due
          to lack of maintenance and to avoid extra potential attack surface
          during Secure Boot Limine usage.
        - Drop support for the legacy config format (limine.cfg) and only keep
          around the new one (limine.conf) introduced with Limine 8.x.
        - Drop support for the (barely worked and seldom used) `chainload_next`
          protocol.

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Introduce API revision 3, for the `limine.h`
          file with several renamed identifiers for better clarity.
        - Limine boot protocol: Specify and implement a new, convenience,
          "Executable Command Line feature".
        - Limine boot protocol: Use monitor/mwait CPU instructions, when
          available, to reduce CPU usage and increase performance during
          multiprocessor initialisation.
        - Add preferred aliases for BIOS and EFI chainload (namely `bios` and
          `efi`) protocol names for the `protocol` config option.

    Bug fixes:
        - EFI (chainload) boot protocol: Fix `path` option alias not working.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Update Flanterm submodule to latest.

2025-01-10  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.7.0 ***

          are provided.
        - Add `path` aliases for `kernel_path` and `image_path` for the Linux
          and EFI Chainloading protocols respectively.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Submodule version/commit bumps.

2024-12-26  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.6.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.6.0:

    Bug fixes:
        - Propagate EFI PXE device handle properly when chainloading.
        - Ensure that, when specifying a `dtb_path`, extra space is properly
          allocated just as is done for EFI-provided DTBs.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Linux on RISCs: General code clean up; pass EFI memory map and initrd
          information as EFI configuration tables alongside already passed DTB
          parameters for the same, in preparation for loongarch64 support.

2024-12-05  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.6.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.5.0:

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Specify and implement new "RISC-V BSP Hart ID"
          feature.
        - Limine boot protocol: Add a new "SBI" firmware type to the firmware
          type feature
        - Limine boot protocol: Add a new API revision 2 to the limine.h header
          file. This replaces many mentions of 'kernel' with a more neutral
          'executable' instead.
        - Config: add 'path' alias for 'kernel_path' for the Limine and
          multiboot1 and 2 protocols.

2024-11-30  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.5.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.4.1:

    New features:
        - Limine boot protocol: Introduce limine.h API revisions to avoid API
          breaks.

    Bug fixes:
        - Limine boot protocol: Amend base revision 3 to keep EFI memmap
          pointer as virtual. Making it physical made no sense and is
          henceforth considered a bug.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Limine boot protocol: Rename SMP feature to MP feature for limine.h
          API revision 1+.
        - Limine boot protocol: Make some types that were void pointers into
          uint64_t's to better represent their physical nature; limine.h API
          revision 1+.

2024-11-25  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.4.1 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.4.0:

    Miscellaneous:
        - Limine boot protocol: Ensure machines with pre-enabled x2APIC are
          properly supported.
        - Reuse a viable framebuffer for UEFI fallback terminal output (like on
          panics) if boot services have been exited instead of bailing out.
        - Miscellaneous build system updates.

        - Limine boot protocol: Misc optimisations to page tables usage.

2024-10-23  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.2.0 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.1.2:

    New features:
        - Add device tree blob override configuration options for the Limine
          and Linux boot protocols.
        - Limine boot protocol: Filter `memory@...` nodes out of device trees.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Documentation: USAGE.md: Update `xorriso` command to produce
          ISOHYBRIDs with Joliet info and an HFS+ filesystem for broader
          compatibility.
        - Increase the size of the `limine-cd-uefi.bin` image to 5760 sectors;
          this allows more and/or larger EFI executables to fit (like for
          example those generated when compiling with -O0).
        - Bump cc-runtime revision to d5425655388977fa12ff9b903e554a20b20c426e.

2024-10-15  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 8.1.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 8.1.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Add missing register saves and restores around call from assembly to
          C code for the x86-64 UEFI port. This bug could have caused crashes
          with certain compiler optimisation levels (like -O0).
        - Adjust size of reserved area of VBE mode info struct to be the right
          size. This bug could have caused crashes with certain compiler
          optimisation levels (like -O0).
        - Ignore UEFI memory map entries of length 0. This fixes crashes that
          could have happened on quirky UEFI firmwares passing such entries.

        - RISC-V: Add support for RISC-V systems without ACPI (using DTBs).

2024-05-24  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 7.5.3 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.5.2:

    Bug fixes:
        - Multiboot 2 protocol: Fix an issue where the 32-bit EFI Image Handle
          tag would be generated under 64-bit EFI and vice versa.
        - Do not set VirtualStart to PhysicalStart when generating the EFI
          memory map; set it to 0 instead.
        - Do not perform additional checks when loading relocatable ELF files
          after verifying that they are of type ET_DYN and have a PT_DYNAMIC
          segment. This ensures that certain relocatable ELF files that were
          previously misidentified as non-relocatable are recognised as such.

2024-05-22  Mintsuki  <mintsuki@protonmail.com>

    *** Release 7.5.2 ***

    Noteworthy changes compared to the previous release, 7.5.1:

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix missing checks in the FAT filesystem driver that could cause
          divide-by-0 exceptions when parsing malformed/corrupted filesystems.
        - Limine boot protocol: Do not reject relocatable kernels with ELF PHDR
          load addresses at or around 0, instead slide them all the way to the
          topmost 2GiB (0xffffffff80000000). This allows setting a base load
          address of 0 in LD BFD/LLD linker scripts which makes LD BFD (the
          default GNU LD) actually emit an ELF with ET_DYN type.

          marker".
        - Limine boot protocol: Add base revision 2. The sole difference
          compared to base revision 1 being that it mandates bootloaders to
          support request delimiters.

    Bug fixes:
        - Fix an issue regarding commit date parsing in the bootstrap script.

    Miscellaneous:
        - General documentation updates and improvements; split USAGE.md from

          useful error message.
        - Avoid usage of reserved C identifiers in certain cases.

    Miscellaneous:
        - Drop usage of "libgcc-binaries" for "cc-runtime". This finally makes
          us able to ship Limine tarballs without included binary blobs, and
          should improve compatibility with more obscure toolchain set ups.
