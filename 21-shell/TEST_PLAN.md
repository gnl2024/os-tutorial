## 🚀 Test Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Basic System Tests (Day 1)

#### Test 1.1: Boot Process
**Objective**: Verify system boots correctly
**Steps**:
```bash
cd 21-shell
make clean
make
make run
```
**Expected Results**:
- System boots without errors
- "Hello from kernel!" message appears
- Memory allocation messages appear
- "Type something..." prompt appears

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ System boots and shows expected messages

#### Test 1.2: Memory Allocation
**Objective**: Verify `kmalloc()` works correctly
**Steps**:
- Run system and observe memory allocation messages
- Check that addresses are page-aligned (divisible by 0x1000)

**Expected Results**:
- First allocation: ~0x10000
- Second allocation: ~0x11000 (or next page)

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Addresses are page-aligned and sequential

#### Test 1.3: Keyboard Input
**Objective**: Verify keyboard driver works
**Steps**:
- Type characters and observe they appear on screen
- Type "END" and verify system halts

**Expected Results**:
- Characters appear as typed
- "END" command halts system

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Keyboard input works correctly

---

### Phase 2: Advanced Feature Tests (Day 2)

#### Test 2.1: Screen Scrolling
**Objective**: Verify screen scrolling works
**Steps**:
- Type enough text to fill the screen (80x25 characters)
- Continue typing to trigger scrolling

**Expected Results**:
- Text scrolls up when screen is full
- New text appears at bottom

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Screen scrolling works correctly

#### Test 2.2: Interrupt Handling
**Objective**: Verify interrupt system works
**Steps**:
- Monitor for any interrupt-related errors
- Check that keyboard interrupts work
- Verify timer interrupts are masked (no ticks)

**Expected Results**:
- No interrupt errors
- Keyboard interrupts work
- No timer ticks (as configured)

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Interrupt system stable

#### Test 2.3: String Functions
**Objective**: Verify string library works
**Steps**:
- Check that `int_to_ascii()` works in memory allocation display
- Verify string comparison works in "END" command

**Expected Results**:
- Memory addresses display correctly
- "END" command recognized

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ String functions work correctly

---

### Phase 3: Stress Tests (Day 3)

#### Test 3.1: Memory Stress Test
**Objective**: Test memory allocation under stress
**Steps**:
- Modify kernel to allocate many memory blocks
- Check for memory corruption

**Expected Results**:
- No memory corruption
- All allocations successful

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Memory system stable under stress

#### Test 3.2: Keyboard Stress Test
**Objective**: Test keyboard under rapid input
**Steps**:
- Type rapidly for extended period
- Check for missed characters or system crashes

**Expected Results**:
- No missed characters
- System remains stable

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Keyboard system stable under stress

#### Test 3.3: Screen Stress Test
**Objective**: Test screen driver under heavy output
**Steps**:
- Generate large amounts of text output
- Check for screen corruption or crashes

**Expected Results**:
- No screen corruption
- Scrolling works correctly
- System remains stable

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Screen system stable under stress

---

### Phase 4: Integration Tests (Day 4)

#### Test 4.1: Full System Integration
**Objective**: Test all components working together
**Steps**:
- Run system for extended period
- Use all features simultaneously
- Monitor for any issues

**Expected Results**:
- All features work together
- No conflicts between components
- System remains stable

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ All components integrate correctly

#### Test 4.2: Error Handling
**Objective**: Test error handling capabilities
**Steps**:
- Trigger various error conditions
- Check system response

**Expected Results**:
- System handles errors gracefully
- No crashes from error conditions

**Pass Criteria**: ✅ Error handling works correctly

## 🔧 Test Implementation

### Automated Test Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# test_wisp_bb.sh

echo "=== WISP-BB System Test Suite ==="

# Test 1: Build system
echo "Test 1.1: Building system..."
make clean && make
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "✅ Build successful"
else
    echo "❌ Build failed"
    exit 1
fi

# Test 2: Run system
echo "Test 1.2: Running system..."
timeout 30s make run &
PID=$!

# Wait for system to start
sleep 5

# Check if system is running
if ps -p $PID > /dev/null; then
    echo "✅ System started successfully"
else
    echo "❌ System failed to start"
    exit 1
fi

# Kill system after test
kill $PID 2>/dev/null

echo "=== All tests completed ==="
```
